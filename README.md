# Infection-Game
Infection is a simple game where you play as a virus and your goal is to infect a red blood cell in the human body. 

I made this game for my bio-med class in 9th grade. We were asked to make a board game or book to demonstrate various micro-organisms in your body and their functions in relation to a foreign entity such as a virus. I decide to make a video game for this using SFML and C++. This was my first time not just playing around with SFML and making an actual game with it.
